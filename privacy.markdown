I use [GoatCounter](https://www.goatcounter.com/) to count the ~~goats~~
people visiting. It's [open source](https://github.com/zgoat/goatcounter).
They don't use cookies or store any personally identifiable
information, not even the IP address. Here's their
[privacy policy](https://www.goatcounter.com/privacy) and
[GDPR notice](https://www.goatcounter.com/gdpr).
I've disabled referrer and UA collection, and set retention to 31 days.
